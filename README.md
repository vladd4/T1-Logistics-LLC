# T1 Logistics LLC

Welcome to the T1 Logistics LLC website, a showcase of dynamic ReactJS-based landing page project, designed to deliver an exceptional user experience for logistics and transportation services. Here's an overview of the core elements and technologies I've integrated:

## Features and technologies

React: Utilizing the power and flexibility of React to create a dynamic and responsive UI.<br>
JavaScript: Leveraging modern JavaScript to implement the logic and functionality of the landing page.<br>
SCSS and Module SCSS: It is a technology that allows you to scope your SCSS styles locally to a specific component. This means that the styles defined for one component won't interfere with or be affected by styles defined in another component.<br>
Multilingual Feature: Implementing a multilingual feature using i18n.js and storing translation strings in JSON files. This approach allows for easy translation management and ensures a seamless experience for both Ukrainian (UA) and English (EN) speakers.<br>
Custom Hooks: Employing custom hooks to efficiently manage state and improve code reusability.<br>
Good Folder Structure: Following a well-organized folder structure, including a "store" folder to hold all information and photos. This structure enhances code maintainability and scalability, making it easier for developers to work on and extend the project while allowing for easy manipulation of content and images.<br>
Animations: Incorporating delightful animations to enhance user engagement and create a visually appealing experience.<br>
Adaptive Design: Ensuring the landing page is accessible and visually appealing on various devices and screen sizes.<br>
